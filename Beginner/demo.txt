If a Tree could Wander

Oh, if a tree could wander
    and move with foot and wings!
It would not suffer the axe blows
    and not the pain of saws! 

For would the sun not wander
    away in every night ?
How could at ev'ry morning
    the world be lighted up? 

And if the ocean's water
    would not rise to the sky,
How would the plants be quickened
    by streams and gentle rain? 

The drop that left its homeland,
    the sea, and then returned ?
It found an oyster waiting
    and grew into a pearl. 

Did Yusaf not leave his father,
    in grief and tears and despair?
Did he not, by such a journey,
    gain kingdom and fortune wide? 

Did not the Prophet travel
    to far Medina, friend?
And there he found a new kingdom
    and ruled a hundred lands. 

You lack a foot to travel?
    Then journey into yourself!
And like a mine of rubies
    receive the sunbeams? print! 

Out of yourself ? such a journey
    will lead you to your self,
It leads to transformation
    of dust into pure gold!
